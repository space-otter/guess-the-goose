      The goal of Hangman is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within
      a certain number of attempts. Players win if they guess the word before
      all attempts are used up.
    </p>
    <ol
      class={css({
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        gap: "1rem",
      })}
    >
      <li>
        One player (or the game system) chooses a secret word, which is hidden
        from the guessing player.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the guessed letter is in the word, all occurrences of that letter are
        revealed in their correct positions. If the letter is not in the word,
        the number of remaining attempts decreases, and part of the hangman
        figure is drawn.
      </li>
      <li>
        The guessing player wins if they correctly guess all the letters in the
        word before they run out of attempts.
      </li>
